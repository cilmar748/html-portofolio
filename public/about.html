<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> Since childhood, I have been deeply passionate about basketball, a sport that has not
    only been a source of joy but also a platform where I have excelled. Over the years,
    I have had the privilege of winning several championships, experiences that have shaped
    my dedication and teamwork skills. This passion for sports has been complemented by my
    academic achievements, which recently led me to secure a full scholarship to study 
    Computer Science at City University of Hong Kong. My academic performance, combined 
    with my extracurricular involvement, played a crucial role in earning this opportunity.
</p>
<p> My enthusiasm for subjects like mathematics, physics, and programming has been a constant
    throughout my academic journey. These disciplines have not only captivated me but also
    allowed me to develop strong analytical and problem-solving abilities. Beyond academics,
    my leadership qualities have been demonstrated through my role in nurturing a basketball
    community that has grown to over 250 members, supported by a robust online presence
    with 800 Instagram followers. This experience has honed my organizational skills
    and reinforced my commitment to fostering a supportive and inclusive environment.
</p>
<p> In addition to my involvement in basketball, I have actively participated in mathematics
    and physics Olympiads, where I have consistently challenged myself and achieved notable
    distinctions. These experiences have not only broadened my academic horizons but also
    reinforced my belief in the power of persistence and critical thinking. Looking ahead,
    I am eager to leverage my diverse skills and experiences to contribute meaningfully
    to the field of Computer Science and beyond.</p>
