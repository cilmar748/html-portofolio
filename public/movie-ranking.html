<h3>Dilan 1990</h3>

<p> The reason i found "Dilan 1990" interesting is because it is related to the
    the teenagers life in the past 90's era. This movie suits teenagers and also seniors
    and it contains lots of romantic scene.
</p>

<p> The reason I found "Money Heist Korea interesting is because of the heist scene
    and also the backstory of this film is really great.
</p>

    story between the daughter of a rich people who fell in love with the leader of
